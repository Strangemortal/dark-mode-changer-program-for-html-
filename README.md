Theme Changer Program
A simple JavaScript program to dynamically change the theme of a webpage based on a toggle input.

Prerequisites
Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
A code editor to make changes to the code.
Usage
Include the provided JavaScript code in your HTML file or link it externally.
Ensure the correct ID is assigned to the toggle tag (checkbox or range) and the stylesheet tag.

How it Works
The program listens for changes in the value of the specified toggle element. Upon change, it updates the href attribute of the linked stylesheet tag, thereby changing the theme of the webpage.
